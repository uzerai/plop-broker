# plop-broker
This was created by SKOOF


Just a simple proof-of-concept for a project generation broker (which was designed to be interacted with via Google Home/Alexa actions.)

Makes use of plop to generate files (which in turn relies on handlebars).
PS: this project was initialized by the app itself -- hence the SKOOF description.
